## 🎯 Overview

The **java-strategy-factory-method** project demonstrates how to apply two powerful design patterns together. With this application, you can see practical examples of:

- **Strategy Pattern**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This allows you to change the algorithm independently from the clients that use it.

- **Factory Method Pattern**: Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses alter the type of created objects. This promotes loose coupling in your code.

By using these patterns, you will write cleaner and more maintainable code.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these simple steps.

### 1. System Requirements

- **Java Version**: You need Java 11 or higher. You can check your Java version by running `java -version` in your command line.
- **Operating System**: This application works on all major operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Disk Space**: You will need at least 100MB of free space.

### 5. Run the Application

- Open your command line interface.
- Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files using the `cd` command. For example, if you extracted it to "C:\MyApps\java-strategy-factory-method", type:
  ```
  cd C:\MyApps\java-strategy-factory-method
  ```
- Run the application using the command:
  ```
  java -jar java-strategy-factory-method.jar
  ```

## 📋 Features
